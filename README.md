# multiple-react-apps
Demonstration of building multiple react apps and hosting them at a single endpoint.

As I go along, I will be using branches to show the progression.

**initial-step** - just as it sounds.  Here I have created empty CRA apps.  This does show the beginning of the folder structure.  Notice that under `src/` we have an apps folder and under that we have individual folders for each app.  Also notice, that under each individual app folder we have the `public` and `src` folders.  This is from CRA, and I keep that through out.  It just makes sense to me.
